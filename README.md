This is a (very) barebones proof-of-concept for an Arabic romanization API.

Romanization functionality is hopelessly incomplete, and API design is pre-design.

Welcome!

##To Try It

Start Server

```
npm install; npm start
```

Run Example

```
sh example.js
```

##Notes

* built using Node v0.12.4
* requires ES6 generators and block scoping
